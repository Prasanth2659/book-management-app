  - **Book Details**: Displays detailed information about a specific book.
  - **Add/Edit Book**: Provides forms for adding or editing a bookâ€™s details.

- **Fetch API**: Use the Fetch API to communicate with the backend API to retrieve and send book data.

### Backend:
- **Node.js** and **Express.js** for developing the RESTful API endpoints.
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `GET /books`: Fetch all books.
  - `POST /books`: Add a new book to the collection.
  - `PUT /books/:id`: Update the details of an existing book.
  - `DELETE /books/:id`: Delete a book from the collection.
  
### Database:
